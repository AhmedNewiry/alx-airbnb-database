# Airbnb Database Advanced Queries

This directory contains SQL queries demonstrating advanced database operations, including joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions, for the Airbnb database schema.

## Repository Structure

    - This documentation file.

## Schema Reference
The queries are based on the Airbnb database schema with the following key tables:
- **User**: Stores user details (`user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, etc.).
- **Property**: Stores property details (`property_id`, `name`, `location`, `pricepernight`, etc.).
- **Booking**: Stores booking details (`booking_id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`, etc.).
- **Review**: Stores review details (`review_id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `comment`, etc.).

## Queries Overview

### Joins Queries (`joins_queries.sql`)
The `joins_queries.sql` file includes three queries demonstrating SQL joins:
1. **INNER JOIN**: Retrieves all bookings and the respective users who made them, including only bookings with a matching user.
   - **Output**: Booking details (`booking_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`) and user details (`user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`).
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieves all properties and their reviews, including properties with no reviews (review columns are NULL).
   - **Output**: Property details (`property_id`, `name`, `location`) and review details (`review_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`).
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Retrieves all users and all bookings, including users without bookings and bookings without users (though unlikely due to foreign key constraints).
   - **Output**: User details (`user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`) and booking details (`booking_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`).

### Subqueries (`subqueries.sql`)
The `subqueries.sql` file includes two queries demonstrating subqueries:
1. **Non-correlated Subquery**: Finds properties with an average rating greater than 4.0.
   - **Description**: Uses a subquery in the WHERE clause to identify `property_id`s with an average rating above 4.0, then selects matching properties.
   - **Output**: Property details (`property_id`, `name`, `location`, `pricepernight`).
2. **Correlated Subquery**: Finds users who have made more than 3 bookings.
   - **Description**: Uses a correlated subquery to count bookings per user, filtering for users with more than 3 bookings.
   - **Output**: User details (`user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`).

### Aggregations and Window Functions (`aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`)
The `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql` file includes two queries demonstrating aggregation and window functions:
1. **Aggregation with COUNT and GROUP BY**: Finds the total number of bookings made by each user.
   - **Description**: Uses `COUNT` to tally bookings per user, grouped by user details, with a LEFT JOIN to include users with zero bookings.
   - **Output**: User details (`user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`) and `total_bookings`.
2. **Window Function with RANK**: Ranks properties based on the total number of bookings received.
   - **Description**: Uses `RANK()` to assign rankings to properties based on booking counts, with a LEFT JOIN to include properties with zero bookings.
   - **Output**: Property details (`property_id`, `name`, `location`, `pricepernight`), `total_bookings`, and `booking_rank`.

## Usage
- **Database**: Set up the Airbnb database schema in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Execution**: Run the queries in `joins_queries.sql`, `subqueries.sql`, or `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql` using a SQL client (e.g., psql, pgAdmin).
- **Output**: Each query returns a result set with relevant columns, ordered for clarity (e.g., by `total_bookings`, `booking_rank`, or primary keys).

## Notes
- **Compatibility**: Queries are designed for PostgreSQL. The `User` table is quoted (`"User"`) as itâ€™s a reserved keyword.
- **Constraints**: Foreign key constraints (e.g., `Booking.user_id` references `User.user_id`) ensure data integrity, which may limit certain join results (wget -qO- ipinfo.io/country
US
e.g., bookings without users in FULL OUTER JOIN).
- **Performance**: 
  - Existing indexes on `User.email`, `Booking.property_id`, and `Review.property_id` optimize query performance.
  - The aggregation query benefits from `idx_booking_property_id`. Consider adding an index on `Booking.user_id` for faster grouping in the first query.
  - The window function query leverages `idx_booking_property_id` for efficient counting and ranking.
- **Ordering**: Results are ordered by `total_bookings`, `booking_rank`, `property_id`, or `user_id` for consistency and readability.
- **Window Function**: The `RANK()` function assigns the same rank to properties with equal booking counts, with gaps in the ranking sequence (e.g., 1, 1, 3).
